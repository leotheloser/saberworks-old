        For most tenants, buying renters insurance isn’t a top priority, especially during the stress of moving to a new home. Even
        if it’s a requirement in their lease, they still might view a policy as an unnecessary expense. But having good coverage
        matters for you and for them, something they might not discover until it’s too late.
        <br><br> 
        During my 11 years as a landlord, I’ve seen my tenants affected by theft, kitchen fires, and accidental
        property damage. In two cases, bikes were stolen off the property in broad daylight. Fortunately, one of those bike
        owners had renters insurance and was able to replace the
        <br><br> 
        bike within a few days, but the other tenant didn’t think renters insurance was worth it. After her bike
        went missing, she threatened to sue me for not providing a dedicated storage shed for her bike. Frustrated and angry,
        she didn’t renew her lease and I lost a good tenant.
      </p>
      <h4>What’s renters insurance?</h4>
      <p class="u-mv-x4">
        Renters insurance is an insurance policy, carried by the tenant, which provides coverage for the tenant’s personal property,
        property damage, and liability from accidental injuries to guests and damage to third-party property. Most policies
        are broken down into two parts; personal property coverage and liability coverage.
        <br><br> 
        Requiring tenants to obtain and carry renters insurance is an industry standard and best practice. When
        you require renters insurance, you are requiring liability insurance, which is an easy way to transfer certain risks
        away from you, the property owner.
        <br><br>
         Best of all, renters insurance typically only costs your tenant about $20 a month, and it’s available from
        most insurance providers nd some property management tools.
      </p>
      <h4> Recommended coverage</h4>
      <p class="u-mv-x4">
        Since a homeowner’s policy won’t cover a tenant’s personal belongings, I think all landlords should require their tenants
        to carry renters insurance. While your tenant’s belongings might not be important to you, they can become a problem
        if your tenant decides to sue you (whether or not you’re actually liable, dealing with lawsuits is expensive and
        time-consuming). Or, if they can’t afford to pay rent because of their losses.
        <br><br> 
        require my tenants to get a minimum of $100,000 in liability and $15,000 in personal property coverage,
        both of which are detailed in my leases.
      </p>
      <h4>What does it cover?</h4>
      <p class="u-mv-x4">
        When tenants benefit from renters insurance, landlords will too, directly and indirectly. When it comes to renters insurance,
        these are the types of coverage:
      </p>
      <h4>Personal property</h4>
      <p class="u-mv-x4">
        Unless negligence can be proven, a landlord is usually never responsible for damage or theft of a tenant’s personal property.
